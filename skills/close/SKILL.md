description: Run the mandatory post-done checklist after Owner sets a task to done. Updates all logs and the spec.
disable-model-invocation: false

**Invocation gate:** Only run this skill when (1) the user explicitly typed the `/ddw:close` command, (2) a hook enforcement message demands it, or (3) you proposed running this skill and the user clearly confirmed. Never auto-invoke from ambiguous context.

Run the post-task close checklist. The Owner has already set the task to `done`. Your job is to complete all mandatory updates.

Task to close: $ARGUMENTS (if not provided, ask the user which task).

0. **Read voice** — read `{workflowDir}/VOICE.md` (if it exists) and follow its communication style for all output during this skill.

1. **Read config** — read `{workflowDir}/ddw.json` (search `workflows/ddw.json`, `.workflows/ddw.json`, then `.claude/ddw.json` for legacy) to get `workflowDir`, `specPath`, `autoUpdateSpec`, and `testCommand`. Resolve user identity by running `git config user.name || whoami`.

1.5. **Sync all logs** — Sync all five log files from source files. Scan **both** active directories and `archive/` subdirectories. **Never delete existing rows** — only add missing entries and update existing entries (e.g., status changes). Logs are a permanent record.
   - `TASK_LOG.md` — from `TASK-*.md` files in `tasks/` and `tasks/archive/`: extract Owner, Status, Date, last Work Log timestamp. Add missing rows, update status of existing rows.
   - `DECISION_LOG.md` — from `DEC-*.md` files in `decisions/` and `decisions/archive/`: extract ID, Title, Owner, Status, Date. Add missing rows, update status of existing rows.
   - `PRD_LOG.md` — from `PRD-*.md` files in `prds/` and `prds/archive/`: extract ID, Title, Owner, Status, Date. Add missing rows, update status of existing rows.
   - `CHANGE_LOG.md` — from `TASK-*.md` files with `done` status (both active and archive): extract `## Changes` section content. Add missing entries, never remove existing ones.
   - `RETRO_LOG.md` — from `TASK-*.md` files with `done` status (both active and archive): extract `## Retrospective` section content. Add missing entries, never remove existing ones.

2. **Read the task file** at `{workflowDir}/tasks/TASK-{date}-{title}.md` to understand what was implemented.

3. **Hard gate** — two checks, both must pass:
   a. Check the task's `**Status:**` field. If it is NOT `done`, block: "Task is not done yet. Run `/ddw:review` first, then set the task to `done` before closing."
   b. Check the `## Owner Review Checklist` section. If any items are unchecked (`- [ ]`), block: "Owner Review Checklist is not complete. Run `/ddw:review` first."
   Do not proceed if either check fails.

4. **Get the actual current UTC datetime** by running:
   ```bash
   date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
   ```

5. **Task file — status + Work Log:**
   - Set `**Status:** done` at the top of the file.
   - Append a final entry to the `## Work Log` section:
     ```
     ### {actual UTC datetime}
     Status → done. Owner verification passed.
     ```

6. **TASK_LOG.md** — skip direct update. The log sync (step 1.5) will add or update the row on the next skill invocation.

7. **Task file — Changes section** — fill the `## Changes` section in the task file:
   ```
   **Summary:** {2-4 sentences: what changed, what files/systems affected, test count if applicable}
   ```
   Then re-sync `CHANGE_LOG.md` from all done task files so it reflects this task immediately.

8. **CURRENT_SPEC (mandatory)** — spec review is required on every task close:
   - If `specPath` is null or the spec file doesn't exist, skip and warn: "No spec configured. Consider running `/ddw:init` to set one up."
   - Read the spec file at `specPath` and the completed task's changes.
   - **If the task changed spec-visible behavior** — update the relevant sections of the spec to reflect the new reality. Use the structure from the plugin's `templates/CURRENT_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md` as reference for section format. For each section updated, set or replace the `> Shaped by:` reference line with the current task and decision IDs (e.g., `> Shaped by: TASK-20260406-auth-flow | DEC-20260401-auth-redesign`). Show the user what changed.
   - **If the task is purely internal** (refactoring, tests, tooling — no behavior change) — the owner must explicitly confirm: "This task doesn't affect the spec. Skip spec update?" Log the skip reason in the task's `## Changes` section: `Spec update: skipped — {reason}`.
   - This step runs regardless of the `autoUpdateSpec` config value. The config controls whether the update happens silently (true) or with confirmation (false), but the review always happens.

9. **Drift check** — run `/ddw:drift` logic. If the status is **DRIFTED** after the spec update, warn the user and list remaining contradictions. The user decides whether to fix now or defer.

10. **CLAUDE.md status line** — skip. Hooks read task files directly; the CLAUDE.md status line is no longer used.

11. **DECISION_LOG + decision files** — if the task has a linked decision:
    - Update the decision file status to `decided` (if not already).
    - Skip direct DECISION_LOG row update — the log sync will update the row on the next invocation.

12. **Retrospective** — ask the user:
    "Anything surprising, difficult, or wrong in this task?"

    If the user provides feedback:
    a. Fill the `## Retrospective` section in the task file:
       ```
       **Feedback:** {user's feedback}
       **Action:** {what changes, if any — e.g., "Added INV-B-20260326-x", "Updated GUARDRAILS.md rule Y"}
       ```
    b. If the feedback implies a new invariant → propose it (owner approves)
    c. If the feedback implies a guardrail change → update GUARDRAILS.md
    d. If the feedback implies a workflow improvement → note it for WORKFLOW.md
    e. Re-sync `RETRO_LOG.md` from all done task files.

    If the user says "nothing" or skips → fill the section:
       ```
       **Feedback:** Clean run. No issues.
       **Action:** None.
       ```

12.5. **Verify proposed constraints** — check that constraints from the linked decision weren't lost:
   - Read the task's `**Decision:**` field. If it references a decision, read that decision file.
   - Find the `## Architect Review → Proposed Constraints` section.
   - Check each proposed constraint for its disposition:
     - If marked **added** → verify it actually exists in GUARDRAILS.md or INVARIANTS.md. If missing (e.g., lost in a session break), write it now and report.
     - If marked **rejected** → skip, already resolved.
     - If unmarked (no disposition) → surface to the owner: "This constraint was proposed in {DEC-id} but never resolved: {constraint}. Add, reject, or defer?" Update the decision file with the owner's choice.
   - If no decision is linked, or no constraints were proposed, skip this step.

13. **Archive** — move the completed task file:
    a. Move `{workflowDir}/tasks/TASK-{date}-{title}.md` to `{workflowDir}/tasks/archive/`
    b. Check if the linked decision has any remaining non-archived tasks:
       - Scan `{workflowDir}/tasks/TASK-*.md` (non-archive) for files where `**Decision:**` matches this task's decision
       - If none remain: move the decision file to `{workflowDir}/decisions/archive/`
       - If the decision references a PRD (`PRD:` field is not "none"), move that PRD to `{workflowDir}/prds/archive/`
    c. Re-sync all five logs — archived files are included in sync, so their rows remain with final status.

13.5. **Milestone phase completion** — check if archiving this decision completed a milestone:
   - Only run this step if a decision was archived in step 13b.
   - Read `{workflowDir}/MILESTONES.md`.
   - Find the `##` section that lists the just-archived decision ID (e.g., `DEC-20260406-auth-redesign`).
   - If the section heading already has `✅`, skip (already marked complete).
   - If found, collect every decision ID listed in that section (lines starting with `- DEC-`).
   - For each decision ID, check if it exists in `{workflowDir}/decisions/archive/`. A decision is "phase-done" only if its file is in the archive directory.
   - If **ALL** decisions in the section are archived → append `✅` to the section heading (e.g., `## Phase 1 — MVP` becomes `## Phase 1 — MVP ✅`).
   - Report: "Milestone '{name}' is now complete — all decisions archived."
   - If some decisions are NOT archived → report progress: "Milestone '{name}': {done}/{total} decisions complete."

14. **Merge guidance** (git only — skip if not a git repo):
    Remind the user: "Task archived. To merge your work: create a PR or `git checkout main && git merge {branch}`."

15. **Report** a checklist confirming each item was completed or explicitly skipped with reason:
    - [ ] Task file status + Work Log
    - [ ] Changes section filled
    - [ ] CURRENT_SPEC (updated / skipped — reason)
    - [ ] Drift check (SYNCED / DRIFTED — details)
    - [ ] DECISION_LOG + decision file (updated / N/A)
    - [ ] Retrospective (logged / skipped)
    - [ ] Proposed constraints (all resolved / N/A)
    - [ ] Archived (task / task + decision)
    - [ ] Logs synced
